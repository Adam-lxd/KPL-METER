C0178784,"A unique macroscopic (gross) anatomic structure that performs specific functions. It is composed of various tissues. An organ is part of an anatomic system or a body region. Representative examples include the heart, lung, liver, spleen, and uterus.",NCI,"The organ image shows a distinct structure comprised of different tissues, which performs specific functions within the body."
C0040405,Tomography using x-ray transmission and a computer algorithm to reconstruct the image.,MSH,"High-resolution cross-sectional images of internal structures such as organs, tissues, and bones are produced by CT scans."
C0444660,An imaginary surface formed by extension of a point through any axis or two definite points; any flat two-dimensional surface.,NCI,An imaginary surface formed by extension of a point through any axis or two definite points; any flat two-dimensional surface.
C0460002,"An anatomical structure that consists of organs and organ subclasses responsible for certain body functions. Representative examples are the gastrointestinal system, urinary system, and hematopoietic system.",NCI,The organ system image illustrates the interconnected organs and tissues that work together to perform specific bodily functions.
C0011923,"Any visual display of structural or functional patterns of organs or tissues for diagnostic evaluation. It includes measuring physiologic and metabolic responses to physical and chemical stimuli, as well as ultramicroscopy.",MSH,None
C0695347,"A specific manner, characteristic, pattern of application or the employment of, any therapeutic agent or method of treatment, especially involving the physical treatment of a condition.",NCI,None
C0041618,The visualization of deep structures of the body by recording the reflections or echoes of ultrasonic pulses directed into the tissues. Use of ultrasound for imaging or diagnostic purposes employs frequencies ranging from 1.6 to 10 megahertz.,MSH,Ultrasound images show detailed anatomy in real-time and are commonly used for monitoring pregnancies and identifying abnormalities.
C0024485,"Imaging that uses radiofrequency waves and a strong magnetic field rather than x-rays to provide detailed pictures of internal organs and tissues. The technique is valuable for the diagnosis of many pathologic conditions, including cancer, heart and vascular disease, stroke, and joint and musculoskeletal disorders.",NCI,"Provides detailed, high-resolution images of internal organs and tissues, offering excellent contrast between different structures and abnormalities."
C0034571,"Used with organs, regions, and diseases for x-ray examinations.",MSH,X-ray images show bones as white and soft tissues as shades of gray and can detect fractures or abnormalities.
C0227230,None,None,None
C0086296,None,None,None
C0030705,Persons under medical care. Use a more specific term if possible. Consider also CLIENTS.,PSY,None
C0220825,"Systematic, objective appraisal of the significance, effectiveness, and impact of activities or condition according to specified objectives and criteria.",NCI,"Systematic, objective appraisal of the significance, effectiveness, and impact of activities or condition according to specified objectives and criteria."
C3640796,The position and orientation of the image slice relative to the patient-based coordinate system.,NCI,The image plane is a defined slice through the body that shows specific anatomical structures in a two-dimensional format.
C0441468,None,None,None
C0870432,None,None,None
C0002978,Radiography of blood vessels after injection of a contrast medium.,MSH,"Angiogram images show detailed views of blood vessels, highlighting blockages, aneurysms, or other abnormalities within the circulatory system."
C0028582,Nuclear Medicine is the branch of medicine that uses radioactive materials either to image a patient's body or to destroy diseased cells.,NCI,"Nuclear medicine images show how organs and tissues function, providing detailed information about the body's internal processes."
C1275506,None,None,None
C0034606,"An imaging technique that uses a small dose of a radioactive chemical (isotope) called a tracer that can detect sites of cancer growth, trauma, infection or degenerative disorders. The tracer, which is either injected into a vein or swallowed, travels through the bloodstream to the target organ, and emits gamma rays, which are detected by a gamma camera and analyzed by a computer to form an image of the target organ.",NCI,"The scan image characteristics show the distribution of the tracer in the target organ, revealing abnormalities or growths."
C0309093,None,None,None
C0032743,"An imaging technique using compounds labelled with short-lived positron-emitting radionuclides (such as carbon-11, nitrogen-13, oxygen-15 and fluorine-18) to measure cell metabolism. It has been useful in study of soft tissues such as CANCER; CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM; and brain. SINGLE-PHOTON EMISSION-COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY is closely related to positron emission tomography, but uses isotopes with longer half-lives and resolution is lower.",MSH,PET scans show detailed images of cell metabolism by using short-lived positron-emitting radionuclides to measure activity in tissues.
